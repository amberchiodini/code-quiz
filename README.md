## Description: 
Created a timed coding quiz with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. 

## Technologies Used 
* Bootstrap 

## Installation:
I implemented a navbar into my html file, established a series of JavaScript-related multiple choice questions, and created a timer that deducted 15 seconds from the time remaining if the user answered a question incorrectly. 

## What is should look like:
